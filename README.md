## Description

The tip disbursement calculator was developed to simplify the process of distributing shared cash tips among employees. It allows users to enter the total shared cash tips received during a shift and the number of hours each employee worked. The calculator then provides a breakdown of the tip distribution, taking into account the number of hours worked by each employee and rounding any leftover change.  As of right now the app rounds all change down, because our kitchen gets the leftover change put toward their "party fund"

## Usage

1. Enter the total shared cash tips received during the shift.
2. Enter the name of each employee and the number of hours they worked.
3. Click the calculate button to see the tip distribution breakdown.
